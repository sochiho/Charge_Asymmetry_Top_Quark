# Charge Asymmetry Top Quark

Durham University Level 4 Theoretical Physics project 

There is a large discrepancy between the measured charge asymmetry at the
Tevatron and the theoretical predictions from the Standard Model for top quark pair
production. This asymmetry arises from a difference in the production rates of top
and antitop quarks in the forward hemisphere. In this work, a parton-level Monte
Carlo event generator is constructed to directly compute the charge asymmetry for
the Tevatron and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is calculated at first
non-vanishing order (&alpha;<sub>s</sub>). For the Tevatron, an asymmetry of 4-5% is predicted
in the lab frame and ∼ 7% in the tt̄ frame which differs from the experimental
result of 15% measured by CDF. At the LHC, cut-independent and cut-dependent
asymmetries are introduced to study the asymmetry in suitable kinematic regions.
Through these cuts the top quark is found to be predominantly produced at higher
rapidities while the antitop is more centrally produced.

In this project, a Monte Carlo (MC) evernt generator was produced for the simpler leptonic process, e<sup>+</sup> e<sup>-</sup> &rarr; Z/&gamma; &rarr; &mu;<sup>+</sup> &mu;<sup>-</sup>. This process allowed us to build a good foundation to be expanded for top quark production.
